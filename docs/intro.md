The Essential AI was initially started as a blog. This section is a series of seemingly disconnected articles aimed at providing a mathematical intuition behind several Machine Learning models.

<h1 class = 'markdown h2'><a href = "mnist-4-neurons">Can 4 output neurons classify 10 classes?</a></h1>

The answer is Yes! Wait a minute! Shouldn't there be as many output neurons as the number of classes for an image classification model? Actually No! We shall dive deep into this topic using mathematical reasoning. This article is a solution to an exercise in the "Neural networks and Deep Learning" book by Micheal Nielsen. -->


<!-- Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
